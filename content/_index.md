# MESA Marketplace

Welcome! The MESA Marketplace is a collection of educational resources and shared project files for the [Modules for Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)](https://mesastar.org) code.
Also check out the [MESA Zenodo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/mesa), the preferred place to share your project files.
This website contains summer school links as well as resources shared prior to 2022/Zenodo.
Please check Zenodo for the latest up-to-date community-shared resources.
